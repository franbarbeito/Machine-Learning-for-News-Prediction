# Machine-Learning-for-News-Prediction
For this project we have established as an objective the use of different processes and techniques to be able to predict and catalog if some news, extracted from various sources, deals with the theme of Hate. 

To achieve this we have carried out an analysis of a large amount of data on news and be able to
design and train a model that makes the aforementioned decision. To develop all this, we
have designed a desktop application in which we will be allowed to both "Train" and "Test"
on a given dataset, and show the result obtained.
